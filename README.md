It allows users to send enquiries to the company and also allows the users to book services with the company,
while advising the user if the chosen date is not available.

The website has information about the servies that are available tohrough the tuning company,
ranging from simple repairs to race tuning the cars. Users can then book their chosen service via 
a booking page.

How does it work ?

The page is built in HTML 5. Bootstrap is used to style the layout of the site, 
and CSS is used to acheive the look of the site.
The Booking page  uses Jquery to process the data that the user has input to the form.
It checks this against some hard coded dates to see the date is available for the customer.
If the date is not available Jquery doesn't proceed with the booking and
displays an alert box notifying the customer
that the chosen date is not available and that they should select another. 
If the date is available Jquery proceeds with the booking and using an alert box, lets the user know
that the booking has been accepted.
